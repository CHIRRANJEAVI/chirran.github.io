I am a second year MS CS student at <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html" target="_blank">NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Science</a>. Most of my coursework is focused towards Algorithms and Cryptography, and I also actively take part in the weekly theory seminars with the <a href="https://csefoundations.engineering.nyu.edu/seminar.html" target="_blank">NYU Theory Group</a>. I am also interest in Machine Learning and Blockchain, and their applications in different domains.

<br />
I was a Software Development Engineer Intern working in Full-Stack Development at <b>Amazon</b>, prior to my masters. I also used to work as a Project Intern at <b>Samsung Research Institute</b>, alongside their IoT team.

<br />
My previous research includes analysing and optimising ML models for specific use cases such as web scrapping, offloading and predicting symptoms of Dyslexia. Recently, I have been working on improving the security of federated learning models using homomorphic encryption and differenfial privacy mechanisms and on fine-grained complexity and proof of works based on them.

<br />
I am a extremely loyal Real Madrid fan and mostly watch Football(Football Football), Formula1 or play eSports during my leisure time. I was also an active Competitive Programmer (in the pre-LeetCode era) mostly competing in <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/barathkumar15" target="_blank">CodeChef</a>, CodeForces and <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/barathganeshkum1" target="_blank">Hackerrank</a>.
